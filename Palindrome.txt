# Palindrome or not

# ask the user for some text;
# check whether the entered text is a palindrome, and prints result.

# Note:
#1. assume that an empty string isn't a palindrome;
#2. treat upper- and lower-case letters as equal;
#3. spaces are not taken into account during the check - treat them as non-existent;
